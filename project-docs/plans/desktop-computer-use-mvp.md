# Desktop Computer Use MVP

Status: experimental implementation record. Future desktop-control phases are governed by the enhanced plan at [`desktop-control-computer-use-enhanced.md`](desktop-control-computer-use-enhanced.md).

This plan converts the Obsidian draft at `~/obsidian-vault/3. System/Projects/Hermes-Relay/Plans/Desktop Control - Computer Use + Overlay.md` into repo-local implementation scope.

## Constraints

- The desktop CLI is a local workspace package and release-binary target. It is not published to npm, and docs must not tell users to install `@hermes-relay/cli` from npm.
- The first slice extends the existing desktop WSS/tool channel. It does not introduce a new relay channel or require a native app.
- The safety model is visible, explicit, and grant-scoped. There is no silent mouse or keyboard control.
- The current native UI does not exist. The enhanced plan accepts Tauri v2 (Rust + React) as the optional Easy-tier path for tray, overlay, permission prompts, emergency stop, and OS-native input APIs. CLI + daemon remain the primary always-working surface.

## Phase 1 Scope

Ship an observe-first tool surface behind an explicit experimental opt-in:

- `desktop_computer_status`
- `desktop_computer_screenshot`
- `desktop_computer_action`
- `desktop_computer_grant_request`
- `desktop_computer_cancel`

The desktop client registers handlers for all five names and advertises them with the normal desktop tool surface only when the experimental computer-use flag is enabled after desktop-tool consent. The relay check endpoint still fails closed for older or unflagged clients because `desktop_computer_*` tools must be explicitly advertised before the server routes calls to them.

## Phase 2 Scope

Add the smallest practical control path:

- durable per-URL desktop-tool consent
- in-memory observe/assist/control grants
- local CLI approval when creating assist/control grants
- Windows-only bounded input actions through a temporary PowerShell/User32 backend
- daemon/non-interactive fail-closed behavior

## Behavior Contract

`desktop_computer_status` reports:

- platform and display metadata
- experimental protocol marker
- local in-memory computer-use grant state
- local desktop-tool consent state
- CLI grant approval availability
- host input state (`available_until_grant_expiry`, `grant_approval_prompt_available`, `blocked_headless`, or unsupported)

`desktop_computer_screenshot` wraps the existing `desktop_screenshot` backend and returns PNG bytes or a saved path plus coordinate metadata. Region capture, cursor certainty, and sensitive-window redaction are reported as planned or unavailable rather than silently claimed.

`desktop_computer_action` performs bounded Windows input only when all gates pass:

- the client is launched with desktop tools enabled
- durable per-URL desktop-tool consent exists
- an in-memory assist/control grant is active
- the assist/control grant was approved from a visible local prompt

If any gate is missing, the tool returns a structured failure such as `grant_required`, `computer_use_consent_required`, `not_interactive`, `rejected`, or `unsupported_platform`.

`desktop_computer_grant_request` accepts `observe`, `assist`, and `control`. Grants are in-memory and time-limited. Observe grants can be created under desktop-tool consent. Assist/control grants require the local desktop client to show a visible prompt; once approved, actions run without per-action prompts until the grant expires or is canceled.

`desktop_computer_cancel` revokes the active in-memory computer-use grant and is safe to call when no grant exists.

## Later Phases

1. Add a native Tauri shell with tray, always-visible overlay chip, grant prompts, action log, and emergency stop.
2. Replace the PowerShell/User32 Windows MVP with a signed brokered native helper.
3. Add UI Automation context and sandboxed workspace execution as separate design passes.
4. Add stale screenshot/capture-id correlation before expanding action types.

## Verification

Current desktop computer-use slices are accepted when:

- desktop TypeScript build passes
- Python plugin tests for the desktop schemas pass
- existing desktop tools remain advertised by default
- computer-use tools are marked experimental and exposed only after normal desktop-tool consent
- action/input requests fail closed without task-scoped assist/control grant
- assist/control grant requests fail closed in daemon/non-interactive mode when no visible prompt is available
- `/desktop/health` exposes the computer-use heartbeat state for server-side debugging
